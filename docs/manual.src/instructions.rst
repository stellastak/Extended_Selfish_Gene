Installation
""""""""""""

SGX is available as a `PyPi package <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index>`_ from https://pypi.org/project/sgx/ and installing it is as simple as

::

    pip install sgx

and then

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import sgx

Caveat: on some systems the package manager is ``pip3``.
