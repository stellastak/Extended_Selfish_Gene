Audience
========

The expected audience for SGX, a *'Quick n' Dirty'* numerical optimization,
includes computer scientists, engineers and practitioners.

* This evolutionary algorithm provides a Sub-Optimal result, which is better than a *"hill-climbing"* algorithm.
* It is a **real, industrial application** where fitness function is computationally intensive.
* **Real-time** application.
* SGX also provides an easy-to-use and **standard interface**.
* The code is **parallelizable**, which means that it can run in parallel multiple threads. There is no need to wait for everything to be completed. Some implementations might be Embarrassingly parallel (see `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel>`_).
* SGX is available as a `PyPi package <https://pypi.org/project/sgx/>`_ and it can be easily installed using `pip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29>`_.
* The modular design allows scholars to extend SGX for custom application.
