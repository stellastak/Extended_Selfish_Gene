Welcome to The Extended Selfish Gene's documentation!
=====================================================

The Selfish Gene Algorithm is a population-less evolutionary optimizer loosely inspired by the dashing interpretation of the Darwinian theory popularized in the scientific blockbuster The Selfish Gene. It enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function.

Since 1998, the Selfish Gene was exploited by different researchers, and a few brand new approaches derived from it. For celebrating (almost) a quarter century mark, it has been rewritten from scratch in Python 3, with improved usability and tons of new features.
