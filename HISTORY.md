The Selfish Gene optimization algorithm
=======================================

The *Selfish Gene* optimization algorithm (SG) is a population-less evolutionary algorithm loosely inspired by the interpretation of the Darwinian theory given by the English biologist Richard Dawkins and popularized as the *Selfish Gene theory*. It enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function.

The original SG was an almost straightforward implementation of a though experiment, only able to handle binary values; it was published in SAC98 as "The selfish gene algorithm: a new evolutionary optimization strategy" (DOI: [10.1145/330560.330838](http://doi.org/10.1145/330560.330838)) and few month later, with some modifications, in ICEC98 as "A new evolutionary algorithm inspired by the selfish gene theory" (DOI: [10.1109/ICEC.1998.700092](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1998.700092)).  

The base algorithm was later discovered surprisingly similar to the *Equilibrium Genetic Algorithm*, developed by Ari Juels, Shumeet Baluja, and Alistair Sinclair in 1993 and never published -- see "Lost gems of EC: the equilibrium genetic algorithm and the role of crossover" (DOI: [10.1145/1329465.1329468](http://doi.org/10.1145/1329465.1329468)). Even more surprisingly, Georges Harik, Fernando Lobo, and David Golberg proposed a quite similar, yet completely unrelated, algorithm in the very same ICEC98: "The compact genetic algorithm" (DOI: [10.1109/ICEC.1998.700083](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1998.700083)). Comprehensive background information on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) can be found in an introduction by Lobo et al. (DOI: [10.1007/978-3-662-43505-2_45](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-43505-2_45)).

Since its appearance, the SG was demonstrated more robust than pure hill climbing, reasonably efficient, and quite easy to implement. It was immediately exploited by practitioners in many real-world applications, CAD problems; and by scholars for various test benches. Moreover, the SG framework enabled the inclusions of tricks that made it effective in quite a wider range of situations. The enhanced *SG-Clans* added to the basic SG a sort of recursive evolution, inspired by the concept of *allopatric speciation*, to escape local optima. Results were published in "Optimizing deceptive functions with the SG-Clans algorithm" (DOI: [10.1109/CEC.1999.785547](http://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.1999.785547)). Non-binary encodings were eventually added in 2000s. Indeed, real-valued parameters was never included as they never worked properly, although a draft paper titled "A population-less evolutionary algorithm for real and integer optimization" mysteriously crawled its way up to [semantic scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Population-Less-Evolutionary-Algorithm-for-Real-Sanchez-Schillaci/6d4025e700d67888ab18ff1e358d15b60bb7167a).

Over the years, the algorithm was reimplemented by different researchers in different languages, and a few brand new approaches derived from it (see [Google Scholar](https://goo.gl/Baw9I8)'s up-to-date references). In 2016, Norharyati Md Ariff, Noor Elaiza Abdul Khalid, Rathiah Hashim, and Noorhayati Mohamed Noor published a comprehensive review on *IOPScience* (DOI: [10.1088/1757-899X/160/1/012098](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/160/1/012098/meta)).
